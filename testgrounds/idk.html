        <p>A letter doesn't need to be perfect—it really is the thought that counts.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start simple.</strong> Introduce yourself. Without getting too specific, you can describe where you're from, and how you spend your time (work, study, training, projects). If you found their story compelling, you can open with that.</li>

          <li><strong>Ask a question or two.</strong> About their interests, what they read, their thoughts on current events, or how they're holding up. One or two questions are enough to stimulate further conversation without being overwhelming.</li>

          <li><strong>Politics is a fine subject, but not required.</strong> Some men want to discuss struggle, history, or theory. Others may prefer to talk about family, their favorite TV shows, or personal goals. Follow their lead if you’re unsure.</li>

          <li><strong>Stay consistent.</strong> Use the same name when you write back. Many men have few reliable contacts—showing you'll keep your word matters more than ideology.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These men are targeted for who they are. A letter reminds them they're not erased.</p>

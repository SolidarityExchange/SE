		    <small>For those wishing to donate to the Solidarity Exchange, please visit our [[[fundraiser page.]]]</small>
                <p><i>The Solidarity Exchange</i> exists to provide support to incarcerated Whites across the globe who continue to support their own, and are ideologically opposed to Jewish power, without any other qualifications whatsoever.</p>
                <p>Many of these prisoners would likely have never been prosecuted if the Judeo-American Empire did not exist, and would likely have been an uninterrupted benefit to society at-large. Similarly, under a fair system, others may have been less severely punished had their ideology not represented the morally superior inversion of the current power system.</p>
                <p>Like any population within America, some of <i>SE’s</i> listed prisoners have been caught up in apolitical street crime, and their allegiance to their extended White family is not directly related to their incarceration.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, some of the very same have been accused of very serious crimes, with credible evidence suggesting a deliberate, and extremely misguided intent to use violence to further their racial ideology.</p>
		<p><b>For the purposes of the Solidarity Exchange, none of this matters.</b></p>
		<p>Like its name says, <i>The Solidarity Exchange</i> is a network that  promotes solidarity with incarcerated Whites who are National Socialist, or National Socialist adjacent.
</p>
		<p>Currently, <i>SE</i> provides various services in order to accomplish this. This includes the maintenance of a [[[database]]] of prisoner mailing addresses and biographies. Additionally, privacy-wary users are encouraged to make use of our [[[letter proxy service]]], where anyone wishing to acquire a pen pal can do so without revealing their mailing address.</p>
		<p><i>The Solidarity Exchange</i> also provides other services, including but not limited to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><i>[[[The Solidarity Dispatch]]]</i>, a periodical newsletter available for free to prisoners as well as visitors to our [[[Web site.]]]</li>
			<li>Instructions for contributing to a prisoner’s commissary fund, allowing them to purchase essential items like toothbrushes as well as snacks and other ‘luxuries.’</li>
			<li>A space for the promotion of fundraisers for the incarcerated or their loved ones.
</li>
		</ul>

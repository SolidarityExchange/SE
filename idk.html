        <p>If you're unsure what to say in your message, that’s completely normal. Here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Introduce yourself.</strong> Let them know who you are (or what name you go by), where you’re writing from, and how you found their info.</li>

          <li><strong>Share what you're passionate about.</strong> Whether it’s labor organizing, antifascism, disability justice, ecology, or music—many incarcerated folks are involved in struggle or care about the same issues. But you don’t have to talk politics. Personal letters are just as meaningful.</li>

          <li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Opening the door to dialogue can help break the isolation of prison. Ask what they enjoy reading, what helps them pass the time, or what they want people on the outside to know.</li>

          <li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> Use the same name or alias when you write again, so they know it’s you. Continuity builds trust.</li>

          <li><strong>Keep it respectful — and strategic.</strong> Assume your letter may be read by prison staff. It’s okay to be passionate, but avoid anything that might be misread as “incitement.” Corrections officers are not known for their commitment to the First Amendment.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Most importantly: be real. A simple letter with warmth and sincerity can mean the world.</p>

One month after Russell was convicted, the government revealed the same witness had been paid an additional $7,000 that he failed to disclose. This payment was sent the week of jury selection.<br><br>Nevertheless, <a href='https://www.baltimoresun.com/2025/05/05/no-new-trial-for-white-supremacist-baltimore-grid/'>Judge James K. Bredar</a> did not think this sufficient to hold a new trial.

The prosecution dismissed this as speculative, refusing to confirm or deny the implication.<br><br>Despite the <a href='https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/brandon-russell-neo-nazi-fisa-evidence-XG2FGX6RCNEY3BPKPHQ4O27SAA/'>unexpected intervention</a> of the ACLU on Russell’s behalf, the government kept their secrets. In a private session with the prosecution, antiracist Judge Bredar agreed that Russell’s rights were protected and that the government did not use evidence from a FISA wiretap.<br><br>Brandon is a veteran of the <a href='https://www.tribune242.com/news/2018/jan/12/bahamian-neo-nazi-jailed-for-five-years-in/'>Florida National Guard</a> and has an undergraduate degree in Nuclear Physics.

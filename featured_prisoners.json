    "bio": "Stephen is currently serving a <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>9-year federal prison sentence</a> after being convicted of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon.<br><br>He is scheduled for release on August 23, 2028.<br><br>During an <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>Upstate New York traffic stop</a>, police realized that Stephen had a warrant out for his arrest for absconding parole in Missouri and made an arrest. During the arrest, police saw that Stephen had decorated his cell phone with a ‘1488’ sticker, which seemed to give police the moral authority to place Stephen under maximum state pressure.<br><br>Shortly thereafter, a search warrant was issued for Stephen’s residence where illicit firearms and ammunition were discovered by <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>an incredible assembly of both federal and local law enforcement</a>. Unfortunately for Stephen, this selective use of state power against pro-White suspects was only the beginning.<br><br>After a misguided attempt to conceal Stephen’s ownership of the weapons resulted in the <a href='https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdny/pr/rochester-man-going-prison-transferring-shotgun-and-ammunition-convicted-felon'>indictment of his friend and the mother of his children</a>, Stephen admitted to his error in judgment and accepted a plea bargain on a weapons possession charge.<br><br>The maximum penalty would net up to ten years in prison; however, <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>sentencing guidelines</a> suggested a maximum of 4.75 years for a person with Stephen’s record. A key, yet often overlooked clause within many plea agreements would prevent Stephen from withdrawing his plea, even if the judge had decided to increase the suggested punishment.<br><br>Around two months later, the same government that just signed a plea agreement with Stephen recommended to Judge Larimer that he be <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>sentenced to 10 years in prison</a>, with a great emphasis placed on his National Socialist views. Larimer seemingly took heed, issuing to Stephen an 8 year long prison sentence.<br><br>During Stephen’s sentencing phase, his own attorney referred to his views as <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>\"repugnant to most Americans,\" and called him a \"neo-Nazi.\"</a> The unoriginal Larimer would suggest to Stephen that he use his 96 months in prison to get an education and to read the antiracist Black poet, <a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maya-Angelou'>Maya Angelou</a>.<br><br>Since he was 15, Stephen had been associated with pro-White societal outcasts, a lifestyle that few know anything about. Stephen had previously told the court that the original purpose for his affiliations was for <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>self-defense in an ever diversifying and increasingly dangerous America.</a> While Stephen’s life was certainly not perfect, for the unapologetic White man, the alternative was unthinkable and undoable. It became not only difficult, but even undesirable to rejoin a society that is inherently anti-White. Eventually, a few mistakes would lead Stephen to join prison gangs, again as a means of survival in multicultural American facilities.<br><br>When Stephen was out of prison, this wasn’t a direct problem; however, once sentenced to 8 years, survival again became an issue. When a fellow White inmate was discovered to be <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>selling weapons to members of another race</a>, Stephen was given a choice by his ‘crew’: ‘correct’ a traitor, or spend 8 years in prison with no allies.<br><br>Stephen chose the former and attacked the weapons dealer, informing prison staff that Whites were going to make a move, and it was merely <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>his time to put in ‘work.’</a><br><br>Perhaps because of this, Larimer would rescind his previous sentence and <a href='https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60875972/united-states-v-pattison/'>handed out an extra year to Stephen</a>, making 9 in total.<br><br>Stephen’s attorney had presciently warned Larimer that singling out Stephen for a long sentence in the American prison system would do nothing to help his rehabilitation — but it seems that when a White convict is involved, systemic responsibility is conveniently shifted onto the individual.",

Chauvin restrained an intoxicated Floyd by kneeling Floyd's neck for about nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street, calling out \"I can't breathe\". Chauvin's restraint techniques were a standard control method at Minneapolis PD. Floyd died while resisting arrest and being on a large amount of illegal drugs. The Media framed Floyd's death as a racially motivated incident.",
